Before we begin, let’s initialize a few helpful libraries since we’re
working with .csv files and .xlsx files.

``` r

# I. Problem 1

This problem uses the FiveThirtyEight data; these data were gathered to
create the interactive graphic on this page. In particular, we’ll use
the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is
to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

## i. pols-month.csv

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv:

1.  Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables
    year, month, and day;
2.  replace month number with month name;
3.  create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove
    prez_dem and prez_gop;
4.  and remove the day variable.

``` r
#putting it all together with pipes

pols_df = read_csv("./p8105_hw2_jwc2177_data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month"), sep = 4) %>% 
  separate(month, into = c("month", "day"), sep = 4) %>% 
  mutate(month = recode(month, "-01-" = "january", "-02-" = "february", "-03-" = "march", "-04-" = "april", "-05-" = "may", "-06-" = "june", "-07-" = "july", "-08-" = "august", "-09-" = "september", "-10-" = "october", "-11-" = "november", "-12-" = "december")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    c("prez_gop", "prez_dem"),
    names_to = "prez",
    values_to = "whitehouse"
    ) %>% 
  mutate(prez = recode(prez, "prez_gop" = "gop", "prez_dem" = "dem")) %>% 
  
#Apparently there was a value of 2 for the President in September 1974, October 1974, November 1974, and December 1974. This does not make sense as the US only has one President at a time. 
  
#The event is likely referring to the resignation of Richard Nixon. Immediately after Nixon resigned on 9 August 1974, his then Vice President Gerald Ford was immediately sworn in as President after. If there was going to be a value of 2, then August 1974 would make the most sense, however there is no value of 2 in August 1974 only the aforementioned months. 
  
#There is no explanation for this.
  
#Regardless, the data was processed as given.
  
  mutate(whitehouse = recode(whitehouse, "0" = "no", "1" = "yes", "2" = "yes")) %>% 

  
  select(-day) %>% 
  relocate(year, month, prez, whitehouse, gov_dem, gov_gop, rep_dem, rep_gop, sen_dem, sen_gop)
```
